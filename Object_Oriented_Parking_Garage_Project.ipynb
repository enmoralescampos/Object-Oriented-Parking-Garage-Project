        "   - This should decrease the amount of parkingSpaces available by 1\n",
        "- payForParking\n",
        "   - Display an input that waits for an amount from the user and store it in a variable\n",
        "   - If the payment variable is not empty then ->  display a message to the user that their ticket has been paid and they have 15mins to leave\n",
        "   - This should update the \"currentTicket\" dictionary key \"paid\" to True\n",
        "-leaveGarage\n",
        "   - If the ticket has been paid, display a message of \"Thank You, have a nice day\"\n",
